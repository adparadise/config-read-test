## Configuration Reader

This is a code test repo to quickly demonstrate:

* Asynchronous Node.js features
* Engineering standards and expectations
* Style, process and problem solving approach

## To Complete

Implement the `ConfigReader` class to:

1. Read configuration from `config/base.json`
2. Override with configuration from `config/<environment>.json`
3. Return an object via the callback which:
